# Mock doc

> A set of documentation that represents what we expect from services hoping to use developer-center-docs to publish their docs.

This README.md is not the docs that would be generated. This is purely for the purposes of being seen on github and then we could link to [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full docs.

## Getting started

1. Git clone this repo
1. cd into the repo
1. Run npx spscommerce/developer-center-docs
1. You should see the results of verify.
